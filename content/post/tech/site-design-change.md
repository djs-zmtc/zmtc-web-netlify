After only a week online, we've already made major changes to the design of the website. We are using [Hugo][hugo] to manage our site content and spent more than a week customizing a specific site theme for the original design. We liked the way it looked, but on later reflection, the style seemed a bit dated and cluttered compared to some more modern designs.

Over the past several days, we've been working on switching to the [Academic][academic] Hugo theme, a more modern-looking theme that is also much easier to customize and adapt to our needs. This theme also natively supports dark-mode if you prefer *(use the crescent moon icon at top right of the page)*.

We will continue to refine the theme over time, but it's time we focused more on getting **content** on the site and less on the way it looks! :smirk:
