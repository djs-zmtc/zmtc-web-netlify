As we ring in the new year of 2020, I've seen many dire warnings about abbreviating the year to '20' when writing dates on documents. Using the two-digit year in dates is very common, but as an article on Forbes pointed out ([Here’s Why You Should Never Shorten 2020 To 20 On Legal Documents](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2020/01/04/heres-why-you-should-never-shorten-2020-to-20-on-legal-documents/)), according to law enforcement using this abbreviation on legally-binding documents can be risky.

In a nutshell, abbreviating the year to '20' makes it trivially easy for someone to alter the date by just adding two more digits to the '20'. So a contract you signed and dated '1/4/20' could be altered to show a signing date of '1/4/2019'. Or an uncashed check with the same date could (in theory) be altered to show '1/4/2021' and be cashed later, even though you thought it had expired and was no longer valid.

However, as Snopes notes ([Should You Avoid Writing This Year as ’20’ on Checks?](https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/01/03/avoid-writing-year-2020-as-20/)), experts are divided on the topic. While it is true that abbreviating the year as '20' makes it easy to alter the year on a document, scammers have always had multiple ways to fraudulently alter documents. 

In my opinion (and as a matter of habit on my part) it is probably a good idea to **never** abbreviate the year on legally-binding documents, regardless of the year in question. Better safe than sorry.
